<p>
Parachute is a platform where an EOS token holder can receive their airdrop tokens. The user is able to view the app airdropping the token and decide whether to claim the tokens. Users will then share their details with the app company, or to refuse them and claim the corresponding value in Parachute Tokens for future purchases. Parachute creates better marketing ways for the app company, better investment means for users, and better links between the two.
