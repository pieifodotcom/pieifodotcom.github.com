<p class="summarytxt">Blockchain hard fork is a complex process requires deep understanding of blockchain technical skills, computing power as well as ecosystem support. Bitpie will support all hard fork token if 1. Mainnet is online and stable 2. 2-way Replay protection is implemented3. Fair distribution and no private key import needed to claim.
</p>
<p>Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) is a fork of Bitcoin that occurs at the predetermined height of block 495866 and therewith a new chain will be generated as the BCD. Bitcoin Diamond miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and will consecutively develop and enhance the protection for account transfer and privacy based on original features of BTC. This will cause a bifurcation of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue on unaltered, but a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. It shares the same transaction history with Bitcoin until it starts branching and coming into a unique block from which it diverges. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency was created which we call “Bitcoin Diamond”.
