<p>
Currently the contents popular on the internet are mostly presented in the form of texts and videos, for which the biggest reason is the audio version of content requires high cost and cannot bring much benefits. LetItPlay is creating a decentralized ecosystem with attention economy which allows any news portal, community, blogger or website to create, distribute and commercialize audio version of content. We not only build links between content creators and consumers, but also connect related service providers like voice actors and studios to realize cost miminization.
