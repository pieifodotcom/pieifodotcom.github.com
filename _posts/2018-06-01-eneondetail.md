<h1 style="color: #2F416A">EON</h1>
<p>
EON is an intelligent high-speed blockchain operating system. Flexible and intelligent allocation of the entire network computing power instantly synchronizes node load and cloud network and enables the average TPS of the entire network to reach over 100,000. Thus all network requests will be completed at the same time, which solves the problem of a mere 4000 TPS caused by numerous network requests generated in a single EOS transaction. As the number of nodes increases in the future, our TPS will eventually reach more than 1 million. TPS is the foundation for determining all other functions and ideas of a public chain like EOS.
