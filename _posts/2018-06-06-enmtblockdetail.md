<p>
The MT blockchain is a fully decentralized social media platform focused on blockchain related content using blockchain technology, adopting an innovative approach that allows users to have the power to create and disseminate valued content compared to traditional media platforms. The user evaluation - token incentive model rewards contributors (including community builders, content providers and communicators) who create value content for the platform, and provides MTS rewards for these contributors. The goal is to link people and and blockchain related content together, and to ensure that the arrival of information through the blockchain technology is valuable to that person. Reducing the cost of people's access to information and improving the efficiency of people's access to information. For the first time, democratic voting allows information to return to the essence of value and give back the value of people's content.
