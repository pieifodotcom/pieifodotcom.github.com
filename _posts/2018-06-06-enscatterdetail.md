<p>
Scatter is a storage tool for EOS digital assets, and at present its Chrome Browser Plug-in version has been launched. A single Scatter can hold multiple Identities which allows for multiple sets of data points. Inside of them you can store anything that an application might need to use in the future, for instance: Identity Name (the username for applications), Blockchain Accounts/Key Pairs, Personal Information (full name, email, date of birth) and Location Information. Keys and Personal information are always encrypted and inaccessible by websites until you decide to supply it. You can choose either to sign each transaction or whitelisting it by adding a Contract Action Permission.
