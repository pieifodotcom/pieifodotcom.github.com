<p>
EOX is a decentralized E-commerce platform that allows EOS based cryptocurrency and crypto-assets to be spent. EOX's goal is to facilitate a global commerce system that allows all goods and services to be transacted in crypto without relying on fiat currency. When seller makes money, the profit can be automatically paid to multiple accounts through smart contract. The profit can be used to pay marketing budgets, suppliers or social media influencers. With EOX, you have a choice to release your personal information (such as shopping preferences) to business and get paid by them for your identity.
