<p class="summarytxt">Blockchain hard fork is a complex process requires deep understanding of blockchain technical skills, computing power as well as ecosystem support. Bitpie will support all hard fork token if 1. Mainnet is online and stable 2. 2-way Replay protection is implemented3. Fair distribution and no private key import needed to claim.
</p>
<p>Bitcoin God is a completely self monitored decentralized community. The community will decide on the quantity and receivers of its tokens. The tokens mined each day will be used for charitable purposes, out of which, 17 million will be airdropped to the current holders of Bitcoins (close to the outstanding amount of BTC). The remaining 4 million will be airdropped for charitable donation.
