<p class="summarytxt">Blockchain hard fork is a complex process requires deep understanding of blockchain technical skills, computing power as well as ecosystem support. Bitpie will support all hard fork token if 1. Mainnet is online and stable 2. 2-way Replay protection is implemented3. Fair distribution and no private key import needed to claim.
</p>
<p>LTE is a hard-fork from Litecoin network. LET not only inherits all the benefits of the Wright coin, but also has faster networks, more sophisticated algorithms (EquiHash), more stable performance, and more mature models. In the early development of LTE, first of all, complete infrastructure, free of charge transfer, user authentication, encryption, digital asset distribution, management and the basic function such as alliance, service to businesses and ordinary users. Next, the improved encryption digital asset payment function and asset transfer function will be completed. In the future, automatic dividend sharing and other more advanced cryptographic asset management capabilities will be issued to enable it to be applied to more industries and scenarios.
