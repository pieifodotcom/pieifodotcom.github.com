<h1 style="color: #2F416A">MEET.ONE</h1>
<p>
MEET.ONE is an EOS global node candidate from Singapore which strives to build the entrance to EOS Ecology. It has a team of professionals from top internet companies who have product development experience of hundred million users. It developed in February the first EOS Wechat applet to help users learn how to do and verify mapping, thus ensuring the asset safety. The users of the applet have now reached hundreds of thousands. In March, it successfully launched the first automated BiOS BOOT process in the community test network. Scholar Testnet was developed by MEET.ONE and other three teams which have been committed to build better EOS Ecology. In April we launched EOS KIT, a Chrome Extension offering the latest information and market conditions to EOS holders. Tested in May, the app performs the function of EOS asset management, node voting, entrance to Dapp and news review. In the future, we will launch the sidechain of MEET.ONE to create an EOS development environment for Dapp incubation. Upholding the value of mutual construction, contribution and equality, the MEET.ONE community has won hundreds of thousands of users.
