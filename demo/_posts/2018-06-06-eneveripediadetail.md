<p>
Everipedia is the next generation encyclopedia rebuilt for the modern age, providing users better experience and personal writing methods. It aims to incentivize its users to create and edit the pages by issuing IQ token to them through EOS platform. Everipedia is mainly consisted of three modules: IQ token module, article module and governance module, which interact with each other to create a sustainable, decentralized, unchangeable and incentivized user network. Users with IQ tokens can vote on the modification of those three modules. In this way, high-quality encyclopedia items will be produced and problems such as lack of modification records and block of partial content will also be solved.
