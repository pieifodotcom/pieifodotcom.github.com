<h1 style="color: #2F416A">Cards & Tokens</h1>
<p>
Cards & Tokens introduced a new publication format that is called Digital Collectible Cards. This format allows users to embed their digital content (texts, photos, drawings, animations, videos or music) in a crypto-card from which they can then sell or auction copies to monetize their work. Cards & Tokens hopes to build a blockchain ecological system and provide users with an amusement platform for making and trading collectible cards, part of which could also be exported to other apps to improve their value.
