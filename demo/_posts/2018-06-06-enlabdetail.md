<p>
Lab Ledger is a blockchain ecosystem built for researchers. It aims to encourage research workers to publish papers or do peer-review on the platform by expanding the influence of tokens and currencies in circulation, so as to solve the three problems encountered during the process of publishing papers: high publishing cost, lack of incentive mechanisms for peer review, and time-consuming publishing procedure. In addition, Lab Ledger will also provide forums, recruitment boards, and crowd-funding channels as the platform for researchers around the world to discuss papers and new scientific discoveries.
