<h1 style="color: #2F416A">EasyEOS</h1>
<p>

We conducted a brand upgrade, changing our name from "EOS.Hedging" to "EasyEOS". EasyEOS is a global block producer community. We are doing our best to be the most promising block producer candidate and serve the whole EOSIO community. We will also strive to run for other DPOS block producer. 90% of EOST tokens will be issued to community users; 10% for community operations. Various partners will be selected from within to lead the development of the whole community. We will establish special funds available only to our users for incubating and investing in high-quality projects. 90% of the profits will be used for token repurchase.
