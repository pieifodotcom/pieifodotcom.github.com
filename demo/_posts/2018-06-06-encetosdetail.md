<h1 style="color: #2F416A">Cetos</h1>
<p>
The main goal of Cetos is to provide users the facilities and channels for mining other cryptocurrencies by means of modern science and technology. The users can exchange cryptocurrencies mined for CETI, among which the locked one can only be paid for medical purpose, while the unlocked one are available to anyone anytime. CETI will be used to provide facilities for areas free of electricity and network access; additional profits will be used for purchasing them clean drinking water.
