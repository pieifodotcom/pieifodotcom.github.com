<p>
EOS Classic is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency (EOSC) that is based on Ethereum &amp; EOS protocol. It aims to build a decentralized app market with its high availability and security based on Ethash Proof of Work consensus. Without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, centralization, or third-party interference, EOS Classic provides databases, account permissions, scheduling, authentication, and internet-application communication to massively improve the efficiency of smart business development that uses parallelization to make possible blockchain scalability to millions of users and millions of transactions per second. Adopting the same EOSIO basic software code, EOS Classic aims to enhance the DPOS consensus by increasing the number of voters to allow 105 block producers the access to verify the blockchain network. In this way, the ecological system of DApp platform can support over 10,000 TPS blockchain networks, allowing no chance of double payment or 51% attack. As a supporter of the tokenâ€™s development, the community gives block producers and voters reasonable rewards.
