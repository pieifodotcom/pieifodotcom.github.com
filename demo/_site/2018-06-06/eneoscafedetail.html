<p>
EOS Cafe DAC is a decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC) that is owned by and guided by owners of BEANS. Our goal is to harness the power of EOS to provide education, infrastructure and decentralized applications to enrich the global EOS ecosystem. We directly fund innovative, fun and disruptive dApps in the EOS ecosystem that align with the values held by the EOS community. We support local and global EOS hackathons to promote the adoption of EOS as the basis for Web 3.0. We develop online and real-world collaboration spaces (Cafes!), in which EOS enthusiasts can meetup and build the future upon the exponential operating system. Our vision is to enable the general public to pay in EOS for common goods such as coffee to increase global adoption of EOS.

The 1 billion BEANS airdrop in the first round has not yet ended. Currently the receivers need to be a programmer who can help develop the community or a South Korean; channels to users from other countries will open soon.<br />
Telegram group: https://t.me/eoscafe<br /> 
eos.cafe DAC will decide how to distribute another 9 billion tokens in the best way.<br />
It is expected that the second round of airdrops will be given away to EOS token holders after the launch of EOS public chain in July 2018. The minimum airdrop proportion is 1 EOS: 1 BEANS.
