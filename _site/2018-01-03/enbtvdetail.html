<p>BitVote(BTV) is a community consensus system, and it forms an self-evolving autonomous community organization and safe cryptocurrency system.
</p>
<p>（1）One-CPU-One-Vote<br />
The appearance of ASIC mining machine broke Satoshi Nakamoto’s assumption of one-CPU-one-vote, as a result, the decentralized operation system of BTC only exists in name. Under the PoW right proof system, the longest chain has the bookkeeping right; therefore magnates of mining pools control large hashrate, and interfere with community development. BitVote adopts CryptoNight algorithm to balance hashrate distribution, which decentralizes the voting right to users who take part in community development, so that users can participate in big decisions of BitVote community. Hard fork will be avoided and true decentralization will be realized.</p>
<p>（2）Block Vote System<br />
About how to establish a more reasonable autonomous community and solve divergence more democratically, BitVote adopts the scheme of using block mark right independently to bid for voting. Community users can participate in bidding equally to acquire block mark right. The mark right will be used in vote signature. Participants can choose from “Support”, “Against” and “ absent”. Signed blocks are effective blocks, and the direction of community development is decided by voting result.</p>
<p>（3）DAO<br />
BitVote is a decentralized and open autonomous organization. Users trust each other and the endorsement of a third party is not needed. It has bigger blocks and handling capacity to deal with transaction data, which can help solve the network congestion of Bitcoin easily. BitVote can be considered as the self-evolving Bitcoin, which has improved expandability and makes Bitcoin be greater.
