Three ways of airdrop:<br />
Communicating with robots in telegram groups and finish related tasks, supply 9,000,000, accounts for 3% of the total supply, the time period is from 3rd March 2018 to when the 9,000,000 tokens were distributed. Have asked the official, it is still on. https://t.me/iryoairdropbot
Make an airdrop that contains 3,000,000 tokens to accounts which hold EOS, accounts for 1% of the total supply, the expected airdrop time is in the third quarter of 2018.<br />
Meetups that join the Iryo are 3,000,000 which account for 1% of the total supply. If there are less than 1,000 people who join the Meetups, the rest airdrop will come back to the airdrop pool, which means it will be airdropped to the EOS holders.
To prevent from the attack of the witch, you need to hold at least 0.1 ETH or 1 EOS in the account by 1st March 2018. Otherwise you cannot join the airdrop, the robot will not approve it.
